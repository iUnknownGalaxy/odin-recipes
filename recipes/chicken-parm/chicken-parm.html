        <h3 class="spacing shift-left">Steps</h3>
        <ol class="wrap-right">
            <li>
                Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Lightly grease a 9x13 baking dish and 
                set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place out 3 shallow dishes. Fill the first with flour, salt, pepper 
                and stir together. In the second dish whisk eggs. In the third dish 
                stir together both bread crumbs, garlic powder, and 1/2 cup grated 
                parmesan cheese.
            </li>
            <li>
                Coat the chicken breasts in the flour mixture, then dip into the egg 
                mixture to coat, then roll in the bread crumb mixture until well coated. 
                Set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour the olive oil into a heavy skillet and add in butter over medium 
                high heat. Once butter has melted, add in chicken and fry for 2-3 minutes 
                on each side until chicken is browned on both sides. Transfer chicken to 
                the lightly greased baking dish.
            </li>
            <li>
                Spread marinara on top of each chicken breast. Top each breast with two 
                slices of mozzarella and sprinkle on remaining 1/4 cup parmesan cheese.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated 450 degree oven until cheese is bubbly and browned 
                and chicken is cooked through, 15-20 minutes. Sprinkle with fresh basil 
                and serve hot.
